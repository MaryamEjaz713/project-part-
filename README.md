1️. Project Title


Java Routing Algorithm Simulator based on Kruskal's Algorithm


2️.  Description


This is a network routing simulator implemented in Java based on Kruskal's algorithm to compute the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). The project is equipped with an easy-to-use graphical interface to insert nodes and edges, graphically visualize the routing process, and see how the algorithm builds up the best path with no cycles or redundancy.
The project is perfect for learning graph theory, routing logic, and MST computation in a visual interactive manner.



3. How to Run:
1. Install Java JDK.
2. Import the project into IntelliJ IDEA
3. Execute the MainApp.java file.
4. GUI window will be launched:
   
 Add/remove nodes and edges using buttons.
 Press "Run Kruskal" to mimic MST construction.

4. Dependencies
   
 No external libraries needed
 Utilizes standard Java SE libraries: javax.swing, java.awt, java.util

5. Learning Objectives
   
Know graph traversal and edge choice
Know how Kruskal's algorithm operates with Union-Find
Get hands-on with Java GUI development

7.Features

- GUI interface (using Java Swing)
- Add/remove nodes and edges
- Visualize graph construction and routing
- Run Kruskal’s algorithm to compute MST
- Display MST edges and logs in real-time
- Handles disconnected graphs by forming Minimum Spanning Forest (MSF).



8.Technologies Used

- Java
- Swing (GUI)
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Graph Structures (Nodes, Edges)
- Kruskal’s Algorithm.


9.Visualization / Demo Instructions

- Nodes are displayed as orange circles with labels.
- Edges are shown in black by default.
- When Kruskal’s algorithm runs:
- Green: edges being checked
- Red: edges selected in MST
- Log section shows step-by-step decisions
- Disconnected graph will show MSF instead of full MST.
